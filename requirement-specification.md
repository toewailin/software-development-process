#### 2. **Non-Functional Requirements**

   - **Performance**:
     - The platform should be able to handle at least 1000 concurrent users without noticeable performance degradation.
     - The system should respond to user actions (e.g., clicking buttons, adding items to cart) within 2 seconds.

   - **Security**:
     - User data, including personal details and payment information, should be encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
     - Implement secure communication channels using TLS for all data transmission.
     - Comply with PCI-DSS standards for handling credit card payments.

   - **Scalability**:
     - The platform should be designed to scale horizontally to support an increasing number of users and restaurants.
     - Use cloud services that allow easy scaling of infrastructure.

   - **Availability**:
     - The platform should have 99.9% uptime, supported by redundant servers and failover mechanisms.
     - Implement automated monitoring to detect and alert in case of downtime.

   - **Usability**:
     - The application should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear navigation and minimal learning curve for users.

### Document Summary

In this **Requirement Specification Document**, we have clearly separated the functional and non-functional requirements for the online food delivery platform. Functional requirements detail what the system should do, focusing on features that directly fulfill user needs. Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform, emphasizing aspects such as performance, security, and usability. This specification will serve as a reference for the development, testing, and deployment teams to ensure all requirements are met. 

This document can be used by stakeholders and developers to confirm that all necessary features and quality standards are included in the project.
