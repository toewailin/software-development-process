#### 2. **Access Control and Authentication**

   - **Objective**: Implement strict access controls to limit data access to authorized users only.
   
   - **Techniques**:
     - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Allow only authorized personnel (e.g., admins) access to personal and payment data.
     - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an additional layer of security for administrators accessing sensitive user data.
     - **Least Privilege Principle**: Limit each user's access to only the data they need to perform their role.

   - **Example Implementation**:
     - Use RBAC to restrict customer service access to essential user details, while administrators with MFA-enabled access are allowed to access more sensitive information.

#### 3. **Data Masking**

   - **Objective**: Mask sensitive data in application interfaces to reduce exposure risks.
   
   - **Masking Techniques**:
     - **Display Masked Data**: Mask sensitive information (e.g., showing only the last four digits of credit card numbers) in order details or profile views.
     - **Conditional Access Masking**: Only display full data when absolutely necessary and authorized by the user.

   - **Example Implementation**:
     - In the order history interface, mask credit card numbers except for the last four digits, reducing data exposure in case of unauthorized access.

#### 4. **Data Minimization**

   - **Objective**: Collect only the minimum amount of data necessary for operations to reduce privacy risks.
   
   - **Data Minimization Techniques**:
     - **Limit Collection**: Only collect data essential for account creation, order placement, and communication.
     - **Anonymize Data for Analytics**: Use anonymized or aggregated data for analytics, avoiding personally identifiable information (PII) wherever possible.

   - **Example Implementation**:
     - Limit data collection at sign-up to essential information (e.g., name, email, phone number), and avoid collecting additional details unless required.

### **User Privacy Controls**

#### 1. **User Consent and Transparency**

   - **Objective**: Ensure users are fully informed about data collection and provide consent before data is collected or processed.
   
   - **Transparency Measures**:
     - **Privacy Notice**: Include a clear privacy notice detailing data collection, processing, and user rights.
     - **Consent Forms**: Use checkboxes or explicit consent forms for collecting personal data, with a clear explanation of its use.

   - **Example Implementation**:
     - Display a privacy notice during sign-up and require users to consent to data collection and usage practices by checking a box.

#### 2. **Data Access and Deletion Requests**

   - **Objective**: Provide users with control over their data, allowing them to view, edit, or delete personal information upon request.
   
   - **User Rights**:
     - **Right to Access**: Allow users to view their personal data through their account settings.
     - **Right to Deletion**: Enable users to delete their account and all associated data if desired.
     - **Right to Correction**: Permit users to update incorrect or outdated information.

   - **Example Implementation**:
     - Provide users with a profile management interface where they can access and update their information and submit requests for data deletion.
