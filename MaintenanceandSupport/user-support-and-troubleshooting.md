#### 1. **Implement an Issue Tracking System**

   - **Objective**: Track and manage user-reported issues to ensure they are resolved promptly and efficiently.
   
   - **Tools**:
     - **Ticketing Systems**: Use platforms like Zendesk, Freshdesk, or Help Scout to manage support tickets.
     - **CRM Integration**: Integrate with a customer relationship management (CRM) system to maintain a record of user interactions and past issues.
   
   - **Ticket Categorization**:
     - **Urgent**: Issues that prevent users from using the platform, such as payment failures or login problems.
     - **High**: Significant issues affecting key features (e.g., issues with order processing).
     - **Moderate**: Minor inconveniences that don’t prevent functionality (e.g., interface glitches).
     - **Low**: General inquiries or non-urgent feature requests.

   - **Example**:
     - A user reports an order delay issue through chat support. The agent creates a ticket in Zendesk, categorizing it as “High” and assigning it to the operations team for immediate resolution.

#### 2. **Collect Details and Troubleshoot**

   - **Objective**: Gather necessary details to accurately diagnose the problem and offer a solution.
   
   - **Information to Collect**:
