     - Manages the end-to-end order lifecycle, including order creation, updating status, and order tracking.
     - Interacts with the payment service to confirm payments before processing orders.
   
   - **Subcomponents**:
     - **Order Processing Service**: Creates new orders, calculates order totals, and applies discounts.
     - **Order Tracking Service**: Updates and monitors the status of each order (e.g., preparing, ready for pickup, out for delivery).
     - **Discount Engine**: Applies promotions and discount codes based on eligibility criteria.
   
   - **Interactions**:
     - Integrates with the **Payment Component** to verify successful payment before confirming the order.
     - Communicates with the **Notification Component** to send order status updates to users.
   
   - **Data Storage**:
     - Uses an **Order Database** (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store order details and status updates.
     - Stores real-time tracking data temporarily in **Redis** for quick access.

#### 4. **Payment Component**

   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Processes payments, handles refunds, and stores payment details securely.
     - Ensures secure transactions, with compliance to PCI-DSS standards.
   
   - **Subcomponents**:
     - **Payment Gateway Integration Service**: Interfaces with third-party payment providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process payments.
     - **Billing Service**: Generates invoices and manages transaction records.
     - **Refund Service**: Handles refund requests and updates order status accordingly.
   
   - **Interactions**:
     - Communicates with the **Order Management Component** to validate order payments.
     - Integrates with the **User Management Component** to allow users to store payment methods securely.
   
   - **Data Storage**:
     - Stores payment records in a **Payment Database** (e.g., PostgreSQL) and encrypts sensitive information using **AES-256**.

---

#### 5. **Notification Component**

   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Manages notifications to users, such as order updates, promotions, and alerts.
     - Supports multiple channels: push notifications, email, and SMS.
   
   - **Subcomponents**:
     - **Push Notification Service**: Sends real-time updates on order status to users’ devices.
     - **Email Service**: Sends emails for order confirmations, promotional offers, and account verification.
     - **SMS Service**: Sends critical notifications via SMS for delivery updates or failed payments.
   
   - **Interactions**:
     - Listens to events from the **Order Management Component** and **User Management Component** to trigger notifications.
     - Interfaces with the **Messaging Queue** (e.g., RabbitMQ) to queue and process notification requests efficiently.
   
   - **Data Storage**:
     - Stores notification logs in a **Notification Database** (e.g., MongoDB) for auditing and analytics.

---

#### 6. **Analytics Component**

   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Collects and analyzes data from various components to provide insights into user behavior, restaurant performance, and system health.
   
   - **Subcomponents**:
     - **User Analytics**: Tracks user interactions, popular items, and conversion rates.
     - **Restaurant Analytics**: Provides insights for restaurant owners, such as sales trends, popular dishes, and customer feedback.
     - **System Health Monitoring**: Tracks system performance, including request times, error rates, and database usage.
   
   - **Interactions**:
     - Collects data from the **Order Management Component** and **User Management Component**.
     - Sends aggregated data to the **Admin Dashboard** for visualization and reporting.
   
   - **Data Storage**:
     - Uses a **Data Warehouse** (e.g., Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery) for historical data and analytics.
     - Caches frequently accessed reports in **Redis** for quick retrieval.

### **Data Flow Example: Order Placement**

1. **Order Creation**:
   - The **User Management Component** verifies the user and fetches profile data.
   - The **Order Processing Service** within the **Order Management Component** calculates the order total, applies any discounts, and creates a new order.
   
2. **Payment Processing**:
   - The **Payment Component** initiates a transaction using the **Payment Gateway Integration Service**.
   - Upon successful payment, the **Payment Component** sends a confirmation to the **Order Processing Service**.

3. **Notification and Tracking**:
   - Once the order is confirmed, the **Notification Component** triggers push notifications and emails to the user with the order details.
   - The **Order Tracking Service** within the **Order Management Component** monitors and updates the order status in real time.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - The order is saved in the **Order Database** for long-term storage.
   - A temporary copy of the order status is stored in **Redis** for quick retrieval by the tracking service.

### **Summary of Component Design**

The **Component Design** provides a detailed breakdown of individual modules within the online food delivery platform. Each component is designed with specific responsibilities, subcomponents, and interactions to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable system. This design not only enhances separation of concerns but also simplifies debugging, testing, and future enhancements, setting a solid foundation for development and deployment.
