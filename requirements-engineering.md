Here’s an example illustrating **Requirement Gathering and Analysis** in the **Requirements Engineering** phase for a fictional project to develop an online food delivery platform:

### Example: Online Food Delivery Platform

**Project Goal**: Create an online platform that allows customers to order food from local restaurants and have it delivered to their doorstep.

### Step 1: Identify Business Requirements
   - **Objective**: Understand the high-level goals of the business.
   - **Business Requirements**:
     - The platform should enable local restaurants to list their menus and accept orders online.
     - The system should support multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards and digital wallets.
     - The platform should generate revenue through commission fees from restaurants and delivery charges from customers.
     - There should be features for promotional discounts and loyalty programs.

### Step 2: Identify User Requirements
   - **Objective**: Gather requirements from the end-users (customers, restaurant owners, delivery personnel).
   - **User Requirements**:
     - **Customers**:
       - Ability to search for restaurants by location, cuisine, or dish.
       - View detailed menus with prices, ratings, and reviews.
       - Track the order status and estimated delivery time.
       - Option to save favorite restaurants and previous orders.
       - Receive notifications for order status updates and promotions.
     - **Restaurant Owners**:
       - Manage their menus, prices, and restaurant details.
       - View and update order status (e.g., accepted, preparing, ready for pickup).
       - Access analytics on orders, revenue, and customer feedback.
     - **Delivery Personnel**:
       - Receive notifications for new delivery assignments.
       - View optimized routes for delivery.
       - Mark orders as delivered and report issues.

### Step 3: Identify System Requirements
   - **Objective**: Determine the technical requirements for the system's functionality, performance, and constraints.
   - **System Requirements**:
     - **Functional Requirements**:
       - The system should support user authentication (sign-up/login) with social media integrations.
       - There should be a recommendation engine for suggesting popular restaurants and dishes.
       - The system must handle order placement, payment processing, and order tracking.
       - A content management system for restaurant owners to update their menus.
     - **Non-Functional Requirements**:
       - The platform should handle at least 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
       - Payment processing should be secure, complying with PCI-DSS standards.
       - The platform should have 99.9% uptime and support multi-language localization.
       - Data encryption should be used to protect sensitive user information.

### Step 4: Requirement Analysis
   - **Objective**: Analyze the gathered requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness.
   - **Analysis Outcomes**:
     - The project scope includes developing a mobile app and a web application.
     - Integrating with third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) is feasible within the budget.
     - Need to evaluate the cost and complexity of building a custom recommendation engine versus using third-party services.
     - Requirements are documented in detail, and stakeholders review them for approval.

In this example, **Requirement Gathering and Analysis** involves collecting business, user, and system requirements, then analyzing them to ensure they are clear, feasible, and aligned with the project’s goals. This helps in building a strong foundation for the subsequent phases of the software development life cycle.
