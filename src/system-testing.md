Here’s an example illustrating **System Testing** for an online food delivery platform. This process involves testing the complete system to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements, covering the user journey from login to order completion.

---

### Example: Online Food Delivery Platform

**Project Goal**: Verify that the entire platform operates as expected, including functional processes (like placing orders and payment processing) and non-functional requirements (like performance and security).

---

### **System Testing Process**

#### 1. **Identify Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**

   - **Functional Requirements**:
     - User can register, log in, and access their profile.
     - User can browse restaurants, view menus, place orders, and make payments.
     - Notifications are sent at key stages of the order process (e.g., order confirmed, out for delivery).

   - **Non-Functional Requirements**:
     - **Performance**: Pages load within 2 seconds under a load of up to 1,000 users.
     - **Scalability**: Platform handles peak loads and processes orders efficiently.
     - **Security**: Data is protected with encryption, and user sessions are secured.

---

### **Functional Testing**

#### 1. **End-to-End User Journey Testing**

**Objective**: Verify that users can successfully go through the entire order process, from registration to order delivery.

   - **Test Steps**:
     1. **Registration and Login**:
        - Register a new user and confirm the welcome email.
        - Log in with the new credentials.
     2. **Restaurant Selection and Menu Browsing**:
        - Search for restaurants based on location and view their menus.
     3. **Order Placement**:
        - Add items to the cart, confirm order details, and proceed to checkout.
     4. **Payment Processing**:
        - Complete the order payment with a valid card and ensure an order confirmation message is displayed.
     5. **Order Status Update and Notifications**:
        - Verify that the user receives notifications at each stage (order confirmation, out for delivery, delivered).
     6. **Order History**:
        - Go to the order history section and check if the order details are accurate.

   - **Expected Results**: User can go through the entire flow without errors, and notifications are received at each order stage.

---

#### 2. **API Integration Testing**

**Objective**: Ensure that the platform’s APIs work correctly and return expected results.

   - **Test Steps**:
     1. **Authentication API**: Test login and registration APIs for successful and failed attempts.
     2. **Order API**: Place an order via the API and verify that all required fields are returned.
     3. **Payment API**: Test payment processing with both successful and failed transactions to verify correct status updates.
     4. **Notification API**: Check that order status changes trigger API calls to the notification service.

   - **Expected Results**: APIs return the correct responses with accurate data, and errors are handled gracefully.

### **Non-Functional Testing**

#### 1. **Performance Testing**

**Objective**: Ensure the platform performs optimally under normal and peak loads.

   - **Test Steps**:
     1. **Load Testing**: Simulate up to 1,000 concurrent users performing typical actions (e.g., browsing, ordering).
     2. **Stress Testing**: Gradually increase the number of users beyond the expected limit (e.g., up to 2,000 users) to identify the breaking point.
     3. **Response Time Monitoring**: Measure the response time for key actions, like order placement, under various loads.

   - **Expected Results**:
     - Pages load within 2 seconds under normal load.
     - The system remains stable with a large number of concurrent users and can recover after hitting peak loads.

   - **Tools**: JMeter, LoadRunner, or Gatling.

---

#### 2. **Scalability Testing**

**Objective**: Verify that the platform can scale up to handle increased load during peak times (e.g., holiday promotions).

   - **Test Steps**:
     1. Deploy additional instances of the application and database in a test environment.
     2. Simulate increased traffic and confirm the platform scales efficiently.
     3. Test the system’s ability to maintain performance as resources (e.g., CPU, memory) are scaled up or down.

   - **Expected Results**:
     - Platform scales automatically and maintains response time without significant degradation.
     - The system uses additional resources efficiently during peak times.

---

#### 3. **Security Testing**

**Objective**: Ensure data security, application integrity, and user privacy.

   - **Test Steps**:
     1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
        - Test that only authenticated users can access restricted features.
        - Verify multi-factor authentication, if available.
     2. **Data Encryption**:
        - Ensure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.
     3. **Session Management**:
        - Verify that sessions expire correctly and that user tokens cannot be reused after logout.
     4. **Vulnerability Testing**:
        - Conduct penetration tests to detect vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking.

   - **Expected Results**:
     - User data is secure, unauthorized access attempts are blocked, and the platform is resilient to common vulnerabilities.

   - **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nessus.

---

#### 4. **Usability Testing**

**Objective**: Ensure the platform provides a user-friendly experience.

   - **Test Steps**:
     1. **Navigation Flow**: Observe users completing key tasks (e.g., searching for restaurants, placing orders) and gather feedback.
     2. **Form Validation**: Verify that all forms provide helpful error messages and handle invalid inputs gracefully.
     3. **Mobile Compatibility**: Test the platform on various devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
     4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Confirm that the platform meets accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) to accommodate users with disabilities.

   - **Expected Results**:
     - Users can navigate the platform with ease, and the layout is responsive and accessible across devices.

   - **Tools**: BrowserStack, aXe for accessibility.

#### 5. **Data Integrity Testing**

**Objective**: Ensure data is accurate, consistent, and secure throughout transactions and storage.

   - **Test Steps**:
     1. **Order Data Accuracy**: Verify that all order-related data (e.g., items, total cost, delivery address) is accurately captured and stored.
     2. **Payment Record Consistency**: Ensure that payment data matches order details and that successful payments are recorded accurately.
     3. **Database Consistency Checks**: Run automated checks to ensure data integrity rules are enforced (e.g., foreign key constraints).
     4. **Error Handling**: Test for correct error handling when a transaction fails mid-way (e.g., payment failure).

   - **Expected Results**:
     - Data remains consistent and accurate, even during high transaction volumes or failure scenarios.

### **System Testing in CI/CD Pipeline**

   - **Objective**: Automate system testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline to verify complete functionality in test or staging environments.
   - **Steps**:
     - Schedule system tests to run on each major release or update.
     - Use staging environments to test under realistic conditions and data loads.
     - Configure alerts for failed tests or performance degradation, preventing untested code from reaching production.

   - **Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD, integrated with testing suites.

### **System Testing Summary**

System testing for the online food delivery platform ensures that the platform meets both functional and non-functional requirements, covering everything from user login and order placement to scalability and security. By running comprehensive tests and automating these processes in the CI/CD pipeline, the platform can deliver a stable, secure, and user-friendly experience under various conditions, ensuring a high level of quality assurance before deployment.
