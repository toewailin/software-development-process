### Example: Online Food Delivery Platform

**Project Goal**: Ensure recent updates (e.g., bug fixes, new features, performance enhancements) have not adversely affected existing functionality. Regression testing verifies that core functions, user interactions, and integrations remain stable.

---

### **Regression Testing Process**

#### 1. **Identify Test Scenarios for Regression**

   - **Objective**: Focus on areas potentially impacted by recent code changes, along with critical functions that are essential to platform stability.
   
   - **Typical Regression Test Scenarios**:
     - **User Authentication**: Ensure registration, login, and logout functions correctly.
     - **Order Placement and Processing**: Test order creation, modification, and checkout processes.
     - **Payment Handling**: Validate integration with the payment gateway and correct status updates after payment.
     - **Notifications**: Check that order status changes trigger notifications.
     - **User Profile Updates**: Confirm users can update their profiles, addresses, and preferences without issues.

#### 2. **Select Test Cases for Regression Testing**

   - **Objective**: Choose test cases that cover critical functionalities, recent code changes, and areas prone to regression (high-risk components).
   
   - **Types of Test Cases to Include**:
     - **Smoke Test Cases**: Basic tests to ensure the main functions work correctly (e.g., login, ordering).
     - **Integration Test Cases**: Ensure different components (e.g., order processing and payment) interact correctly.
     - **Functional Test Cases**: Verify that each feature works as intended and meets user requirements.
     - **Edge Case Scenarios**: Test boundary conditions to confirm that the system handles unusual or unexpected inputs gracefully.

#### 3. **Automation for Regression Testing**

   - **Objective**: Use automation to expedite regression testing, especially for frequently tested scenarios and repetitive tasks.
   
   - **Tools**: Selenium, Cypress, or TestCafe for front-end automation; Postman or RestAssured for API testing.
   
   - **Automated Test Examples**:
     - **Login and Authentication Test**: Automated tests for valid and invalid login attempts to confirm login functionality.
     - **Order Placement Workflow**: Automation of the complete order flow, including adding items to the cart, placing an order, and making payments.
     - **Payment Processing Test**: Validate the payment flow, ensuring successful and failed transactions are handled correctly.

### **Regression Testing Scenarios**

#### 1. **User Authentication and Authorization**

   - **Objective**: Confirm that recent changes have not affected user authentication, ensuring login, logout, and session management still work correctly.
   
   - **Test Steps**:
     1. Log in with valid credentials and verify access to the dashboard.
     2. Attempt to log in with invalid credentials and confirm appropriate error messages.
     3. Log out and ensure restricted access to protected endpoints without a session.

   - **Expected Results**: Authentication functions as expected, with valid sessions maintained and terminated correctly.

#### 2. **Order Placement and Checkout Process**

   - **Objective**: Ensure the entire order flow remains intact after recent updates.
   
   - **Test Steps**:
     1. Add items to the cart from various restaurants, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout.
     2. Complete the order with valid payment information and verify the order confirmation.
     3. Cancel or modify the order to ensure that order updates work as expected.

   - **Expected Results**: Users can add, modify, and confirm orders, with order statuses updating correctly.

#### 3. **Payment Gateway Integration**

   - **Objective**: Verify that recent changes haven’t impacted the payment gateway integration, ensuring successful and unsuccessful payments are processed correctly.
   
   - **Test Steps**:
     1. Place an order and complete payment with valid card details to confirm a successful transaction.
     2. Attempt payment with invalid details to confirm that payment failures are handled correctly.
     3. Verify payment confirmation triggers the appropriate order status update.

   - **Expected Results**: Payment processes correctly, updating the order status based on the payment outcome.

#### 4. **Order Status Notifications**

   - **Objective**: Ensure order status notifications still function correctly after recent updates.
   
   - **Test Steps**:
     1. Place an order and monitor notifications triggered by status updates (e.g., “Order Confirmed,” “Out for Delivery”).
     2. Confirm that notifications are received by users on different devices (e.g., email, SMS, in-app).
     3. Update the order status manually and verify the notification’s content and timing.

   - **Expected Results**: Notifications are accurate and delivered promptly according to the order status.

#### 5. **User Profile Management**

   - **Objective**: Confirm that recent changes have not affected the ability to update user profiles and settings.
   
   - **Test Steps**:
     1. Log in and edit profile information (e.g., name, contact details, address).
     2. Save the changes and log out, then log back in to verify the updates.
     3. Try to update fields with invalid data (e.g., phone numbers in the wrong format) to confirm validation rules.

   - **Expected Results**: User profiles are updated successfully, and validation rules are enforced.

### **Regression Testing Strategy**

#### 1. **Test Automation Coverage**

   - **Objective**: Automate as many regression test cases as possible to speed up testing and maintain consistency.
   - **Approach**:
     - Prioritize automating stable, frequently tested areas like login, order processing, and payments.
     - Create reusable scripts for repetitive tests, like adding items to the cart and completing payments.
   
#### 2. **Incremental Testing**

   - **Objective**: Test incrementally based on code changes, focusing on recently modified components.
   - **Approach**:
     - Identify the modules impacted by code changes (e.g., updates to order processing) and prioritize testing in those areas.
     - Run full regression tests on critical features after major updates to catch any overlooked issues.

#### 3. **Regression Testing in CI/CD Pipeline**

   - **Objective**: Integrate regression testing into the CI/CD pipeline to catch defects early in development.
   - **Steps**:
     - Automate regression tests to run on every code commit, pull request, or major deployment.
     - Configure the pipeline to halt deployment if critical tests fail, ensuring issues are addressed promptly.
   
   - **Tools**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD integrated with automated testing frameworks.

### **Regression Testing Environment**

   - **Objective**: Perform regression testing in an environment that closely mirrors production to ensure accurate results.
   
   - **Setup**:
     - Deploy the latest code and database snapshot to a staging environment.
     - Simulate real user data and interactions to mirror actual usage conditions.

### **Analyzing Regression Test Results and Reporting**

   - **Objective**: Document test results, identify new defects, and ensure all issues are resolved before deployment.
   
   - **Report Contents**:
     - **Summary**: Overview of tested features and results.
     - **Defects Found**: List of new or recurring issues, with severity levels and screenshots.
     - **Comparison with Previous Results**: Identify areas that previously passed but now show issues.
     - **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for developers to address defects.

### **Regression Testing Summary**

Regression testing for the online food delivery platform validates that recent changes haven’t affected existing functionalities, maintaining a stable user experience across features like ordering, payment, and notifications. Automated tests streamline this process, and integration with the CI/CD pipeline ensures defects are detected and fixed early. Thorough testing in a production-like environment provides confidence that the platform remains reliable and performs as expected post-deployment.
