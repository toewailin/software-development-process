Here’s an example illustrating **Coding and Unit Testing** for an online food delivery platform, focusing on writing clean, maintainable source code for individual components and performing unit tests to validate functionality.

---

### Example: Online Food Delivery Platform

**Project Goal**: Develop and test the core components for functionalities like user registration, order processing, and payment handling. Each component is written following best coding practices, with unit tests to ensure reliable functionality.

---

### **Coding and Unit Testing Process**

#### 1. **Coding Standards and Best Practices**

   - **Objective**: Establish coding conventions to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the development team.
   
   - **Standards**:
     - **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. For example, use `orderTotal` instead of `ot`.
     - **Modular Code**: Break down code into reusable functions and modules for easier testing and debugging.
     - **Error Handling**: Implement structured error handling (e.g., using `try...catch` in JavaScript) to manage exceptions gracefully.
     - **Documentation**: Comment complex functions and use docstrings (in languages like Python) to explain methods and classes.
   
   - **Tools**:
     - Use linters (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python) to enforce coding standards.
     - Code reviews are conducted before merging to ensure adherence to best practices.

#### 2. **Example Code for Order Processing**

   **Component**: Order Processing Service  
   **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)

   ```javascript
   // orderService.js

   class OrderService {
       constructor(paymentService, notificationService) {
           this.paymentService = paymentService;
           this.notificationService = notificationService;
       }

       async createOrder(userId, items) {
           // Calculate order total
           const totalAmount = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);

           // Initiate order in database (example with MongoDB)
           const order = new Order({
               userId,
               items,
               totalAmount,
               status: 'Pending'
           });
           await order.save();

           // Process payment
           const paymentResult = await this.paymentService.processPayment(userId, totalAmount);

           if (paymentResult.success) {
               order.status = 'Confirmed';
               await order.save();
               
               // Notify user
               await this.notificationService.sendOrderConfirmation(userId, order._id);
           } else {
               order.status = 'Failed';
               await order.save();
           }

           return order;
       }
   }

   module.exports = OrderService;
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - The `OrderService` class defines a `createOrder` function that calculates the total, saves the order, processes payment, and updates order status based on payment results.
   - Dependencies like `paymentService` and `notificationService` are injected for modularity and easy testing.

#### 3. **Unit Testing Example**

   **Tool**: Jest (JavaScript Testing Framework)  
   **Test Cases**: Validate key functionalities, such as order creation, total calculation, and status updates.

   **Test Code**:

   ```javascript
   // orderService.test.js

   const OrderService = require('./orderService');
   const PaymentServiceMock = { processPayment: jest.fn() };
   const NotificationServiceMock = { sendOrderConfirmation: jest.fn() };

   describe('OrderService', () => {
       let orderService;

       beforeEach(() => {
           orderService = new OrderService(PaymentServiceMock, NotificationServiceMock);
           PaymentServiceMock.processPayment.mockClear();
           NotificationServiceMock.sendOrderConfirmation.mockClear();
       });

       it('should create an order with correct total amount', async () => {
           const items = [
               { price: 10, quantity: 2 },
               { price: 5, quantity: 3 }
           ];

           const order = await orderService.createOrder('user123', items);

           expect(order.totalAmount).toBe(35);
           expect(order.status).toBe('Pending');
       });

       it('should confirm order if payment is successful', async () => {
           PaymentServiceMock.processPayment.mockResolvedValue({ success: true });

           const order = await orderService.createOrder('user123', [{ price: 20, quantity: 1 }]);

           expect(order.status).toBe('Confirmed');
           expect(PaymentServiceMock.processPayment).toHaveBeenCalled();
           expect(NotificationServiceMock.sendOrderConfirmation).toHaveBeenCalledWith('user123', order._id);
       });

       it('should fail order if payment fails', async () => {
           PaymentServiceMock.processPayment.mockResolvedValue({ success: false });

           const order = await orderService.createOrder('user123', [{ price: 15, quantity: 2 }]);

           expect(order.status).toBe('Failed');
           expect(NotificationServiceMock.sendOrderConfirmation).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
       });
   });
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **Mocking**: `PaymentServiceMock` and `NotificationServiceMock` simulate external dependencies for isolated testing.
   - **Test Cases**:
     - **Correct Total Calculation**: Ensures that the order’s total amount is accurately calculated.
     - **Successful Payment**: Verifies that the order status is updated to “Confirmed” when payment is successful, and the user receives a confirmation notification.
     - **Failed Payment**: Checks that the order status is set to “Failed” if payment is unsuccessful, and no notification is sent.

   **Test Execution**:
   - Run `jest orderService.test.js` to execute the test cases and check for any failed tests.
   - Jest provides detailed feedback for each test, allowing developers to verify that all critical paths work as expected.

#### 4. **Continuous Integration (CI) and Test Automation**

   - **Objective**: Integrate automated testing into the CI pipeline for consistent and reliable code verification.
   
   - **Setup**:
     - Use CI tools like **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins** to run tests automatically on every commit or pull request.
     - Define CI workflows that run unit tests on each commit to ensure no breaking changes are introduced.
   
   - **Benefits**:
     - Early detection of issues before code reaches production.
     - Reduces manual testing efforts, enabling faster deployments.

---

#### 5. **Test Coverage and Reporting**

   - **Objective**: Ensure adequate test coverage for all critical functions in the code.
   
   - **Code Coverage Tool**: Use tools like **Istanbul** (for JavaScript) or integrated coverage in Jest to measure the percentage of code covered by tests.
   - **Reports**:
     - Generate coverage reports to identify untested parts of the code and focus future testing efforts on these areas.
     - Aim for high coverage (e.g., 80–90%) on critical components like order processing and payment handling.

### **Coding and Unit Testing Summary**

The **Coding and Unit Testing** process for the online food delivery platform involves writing clean, modular code for individual components and validating them with comprehensive unit tests. Using mocks and automated CI workflows helps ensure that each component functions correctly and independently. This approach maintains code reliability and improves confidence in the platform’s stability as it scales and new features are added.
