### **Decision-Making and Approval**

#### 1. **Evaluate with Change Control Board (CCB)**

   - **Objective**: Present changes to a Change Control Board (CCB) or decision-making team for review and approval.
   
   - **CCB Responsibilities**:
     - **Review Impact Analysis**: Examine the potential impact on timeline, budget, and resources.
     - **Align with Project Goals**: Determine if the change aligns with the project’s strategic goals.
     - **Make a Decision**: Approve, defer, or reject the change request based on value and feasibility.

   - **Example**:
     - The CCB reviews the estimated delivery time feature request and decides to defer it to the next release due to its impact on the current project’s timeline and budget.

#### 2. **Document Approved Changes**

   - **Objective**: Record approved changes to ensure clear communication and accountability.
   
   - **Documentation**:
     - **Change Log**: Record the change request, its approval status, expected timeline impact, and assigned resources.
     - **Updated Project Documents**: Modify relevant documents, such as the project scope statement, timeline, and budget.
     - **Change Communication**: Notify the team and stakeholders of approved changes and how they affect the project.

   - **Example Documentation**:
     - The estimated delivery time feature is added to the change log with notes on why it was deferred and scheduled for the next development cycle.

### **Implementing Approved Changes**

#### 1. **Allocate Resources and Update Schedule**

   - **Objective**: Assign resources, update the project schedule, and integrate the change into the development workflow.
   
   - **Resource Allocation**:
     - **Update Task Assignments**: Adjust team assignments to include tasks for the approved change.
     - **Budget Adjustment**: Allocate any additional budget needed for resources or tools required by the change.
     - **Timeline Update**: Update the project timeline to reflect the additional development, testing, and review time for the change.

   - **Example**:
     - If a minor change request to improve delivery location accuracy is approved, the Project Manager assigns it to the backend developer and extends the testing phase by one day.

#### 2. **Track Change Progress and Perform Testing**

   - **Objective**: Track the implementation of changes, ensuring they meet requirements without affecting other project components.
   
   - **Implementation Tracking**:
     - **Progress Updates**: Include the change status in regular project updates to monitor completion.
     - **Testing**: Test the implemented change thoroughly to verify that it meets specifications and doesn’t disrupt existing features.
     - **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Conduct regression testing to ensure the change doesn’t introduce new issues in the platform.

   - **Example**:
     - The backend developer integrates location accuracy improvements, which are tested during QA to confirm that location data is more precise without affecting other tracking features.
