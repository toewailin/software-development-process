Here’s an example illustrating **Data Migration** planning for an online food delivery platform, focusing on transferring data from legacy systems or external sources into the new platform’s database. This process includes defining the data migration strategy, mapping data, and ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

---

### Example: Online Food Delivery Platform

**Project Goal**: Migrate data from a legacy system or external source (e.g., previous order records, user profiles, restaurant information) to the new platform while preserving data integrity, minimizing downtime, and ensuring compatibility.

---

### **Data Migration Process**

#### 1. **Define Data Migration Objectives**

   - **Objective**: Establish clear goals for what data needs to be migrated, the timeline, and the scope of the migration.
   - **Data to Migrate**:
     - **User Profiles**: Customer and restaurant owner accounts.
     - **Restaurant Data**: Restaurant details, menus, and ratings.
     - **Order History**: Previous order records, including items, quantities, and status.
     - **Payment Records**: Associated payment information for each order.
   - **Success Criteria**:
     - Data accuracy and completeness in the new system.
     - Minimal downtime during migration.
     - Compatibility with the new system’s data structures.

---

#### 2. **Migration Strategy and Approach**

   - **Strategy**: Select the migration approach based on data volume, complexity, and acceptable downtime.
   
   - **Approaches**:
     - **Full Migration**: Move all data at once, ideal for simpler data structures with minimal downtime requirements.
     - **Incremental Migration**: Transfer data in batches, useful for large datasets to reduce downtime and facilitate testing.
     - **ETL Process**: Use an **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** approach to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading efficiently.
   
   - **Tools**:
     - **ETL Tools**: Use tools like **Talend**, **Apache NiFi**, or **AWS Data Migration Service (DMS)** to manage the data migration process.
     - **Custom Scripts**: Use scripts (e.g., Python, SQL) for data transformation, validation, and loading.

---

#### 3. **Data Mapping and Transformation**

   - **Objective**: Map data from the legacy system’s format to the new system’s schema and apply necessary transformations for compatibility.

   - **Data Mapping Plan**:
     - **Users**:
       - Map `legacy_user_id` to `user_id` in the new system.
       - Convert roles (e.g., `1 = customer`, `2 = restaurant_owner`) to standard role names (e.g., `customer`, `restaurant_owner`).
     - **Restaurants**:
       - Map `old_restaurant_id` to `restaurant_id` and check address formats for compatibility.
       - Map menu items from the legacy format, ensuring compatibility with the new system’s menu schema.
     - **Orders**:
       - Migrate `order_id`, `user_id`, and `restaurant_id` to new fields.
       - Convert order status values to match the new platform’s standardized status names (e.g., `0 = pending`, `1 = confirmed`).
     - **Payments**:
       - Map payment fields and ensure consistency in payment methods (e.g., credit card names, transaction IDs).

   - **Data Transformation**:
     - **Date Format Standardization**: Convert legacy date formats (e.g., `MM-DD-YYYY`) to ISO standard (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
     - **Currency Conversion**: If currency values differ, apply a conversion to align with the platform’s currency.
     - **Data Cleansing**: Remove duplicate or outdated entries and validate email addresses, phone numbers, and address formats.

---

#### 4. **Data Validation and Testing**

   - **Objective**: Ensure data accuracy and integrity through rigorous validation and testing after each migration phase.
   
   - **Data Validation Methods**:
     - **Row Counts**: Compare the number of records in source and target databases for each table to ensure completeness.
     - **Checksum Validation**: Generate checksums for records in the legacy and new system to detect discrepancies.
     - **Field-by-Field Comparison**: Randomly sample records and compare fields manually to confirm accuracy.
   
   - **Testing Phases**:
     - **Pre-Migration Testing**: Test data extraction and transformation on a subset to verify that data can be mapped accurately.
     - **Post-Migration Testing**: Validate data in the new system after loading, checking for completeness, accuracy, and consistency.
     - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Allow end-users or stakeholders to verify that migrated data appears and functions correctly in the new system.

#### 5. **Data Migration Execution**

   - **Objective**: Implement the actual data migration in phases or as a single operation, depending on the strategy.
   
   - **Execution Steps**:
     1. **Backup Legacy Data**: Create a backup of the legacy database to prevent data loss.
     2. **Extract Data**: Use ETL tools or custom scripts to pull data from the legacy system.
     3. **Transform Data**: Apply data transformations as defined in the mapping plan.
     4. **Load Data**: Insert transformed data into the new system’s database, ensuring that dependencies (e.g., foreign key constraints) are respected.
     5. **Indexing**: Rebuild indexes on the new database to optimize performance after loading large volumes of data.

   - **Monitoring**:
     - Monitor the migration process for any errors, track loading times, and validate real-time data transfers (if incremental).
     - Log errors and resolve any failed entries immediately to ensure data consistency.

---

#### 6. **Post-Migration Validation and Cleanup**

   - **Objective**: Validate migrated data, check for any issues, and perform final cleanup to optimize performance.
   
   - **Post-Migration Validation**:
     - **Re-run Data Validation Tests**: Ensure the migrated data is accurate and complete.
     - **Rebuild Relationships**: Verify foreign key constraints and relationships between entities (e.g., user and order IDs) are intact.
     - **Application Testing**: Test the platform’s features (e.g., order history, user profiles) to confirm data accessibility and functionality.
   
   - **Cleanup**:
     - Remove any temporary tables or test data created during the migration process.
     - Update or remove legacy system references and ensure any access permissions are revoked.

---

#### 7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**

   - **Objective**: Monitor migrated data and address any post-migration issues that may arise, ensuring long-term data integrity.
   
   - **Post-Migration Monitoring**:
     - Set up ongoing monitoring to track data consistency and catch any unexpected issues.
     - Establish a feedback loop with users to report any missing or incorrect data.
   
   - **Maintenance Tasks**:
     - Schedule regular database backups and continue with performance optimization tasks.
     - Document the data migration process, including mapping details, validations, and lessons learned for future reference.

### **Data Migration Summary**

The **Data Migration** process for the online food delivery platform involves careful planning, data mapping, validation, and testing to ensure a smooth transition from the legacy system. This structured approach guarantees that migrated data is accurate, reliable, and compatible with the new platform. By following a defined strategy and employing rigorous testing, the data migration ensures minimal disruption and a seamless user experience in the new system.
